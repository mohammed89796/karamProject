    <h2>About Karam Charitable Foundation</h2>

    <div class="about-paragraph">
      Karam Charity Foundation, a registered non-governmental charitable organization in Egypt, was established in 2008 by Dr. Mohamed, the late Dr. Ahmed, and the late Ambassador Mohamed Shaker. Karam Charity Foundation also manages an exceptional project of great importance to the health and wellbeing of the Egyptian people, relying entirely on donations. The Foundation is responsible for the strategic management of this site, and due to the existing pressure on the site, the Board of Trustees made an informed decision to start establishing the Karam Global Center in Cairo to meet the severe and growing need for disease treatment, assist the needy, and carry out zakat, charity, and food and clothing donations, especially for the most vulnerable groups, through continuous integration of treatment, research, and skills development. The foundation is managed by one of the most reputable boards of trustees in Egypt.
